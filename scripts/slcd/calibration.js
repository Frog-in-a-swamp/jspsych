Auditory Calibration Script

This short module allows participants
to adjust their volume to a comfortable
level (same RMS as the sounds in the study)
and then provides a short headphone
assessment. The headphone assessment takes
advantage of Huggins pitches and is described
in detail in the following paper:

Milne, A.E., Bianco, R., Poole, K.C. et al.
An online headphone screening test based on dichotic pitch.
Behav Res 53, 1551â€“1562 (2021).
https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01514-0

On each trial, participants hear three samples of
noise. One of the noise samples has a faint
tone embedded in it, but this is only perceptible
when there is clear channel separation (i.e., a
dichotic listening situation). Thus, performance
is expected to be dichotomous, with near-chance
(2/6) performance for participants not wearing
headphones and near-perfect (5+/6) performance
for participants wearing headphones.

Thank you to Milne and colleagues for providing
these materials on GitHub!
