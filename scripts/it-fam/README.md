# Extant Understanding of Italian

Follow-up to the "Statistical Learning of Italian" project. 
Participants hear Italian words, part-words, and non-words and rate these stimuli in terms of how familiar / likely they are to be encountered. 
Note: This is a baseline assessment - no exposure to Italian is provided to participants

Finally, as a simple check of compliance and comprehension, participants complete a similar task at the end with English words, part-words, and non-words.
