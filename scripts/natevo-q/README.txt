Questionnaire README
Description
Participants complete four questionnaires, answering questions about themselves and about the sounds they heard in the study. The four questionnaires are:
1. The Prosocial Behavioural Intentions Scale (PBIS) – assesses intentions of acting in a prosocial manner
2. The Prosocialness Scale for Adults (PSA) – trait-level assessment of prosocial behaviour
3. The Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS) – questions answered in relation to the environmental sounds (how restorative were the sounds)
4. The Mental Bandwidth Scale (MBS) - questions answered in relation to the environmental sounds (how much mental bandwidth was available while listening)
The PBIS contains four questions; the PSA contains 16 questions; the PRS contains 10 questions; the MBS contains 8 questions. In total, this should take around 10 minutes to complete.
Using the Script
URL Variables
The script allows URL variables, which are highly recommended. Specifically, one is able to specify the participant identifier and the session in the URL of the task. For example, if you accessed the task using the following link:
https://svanhedger.github.io/jspsych/scripts/natevo-q?id=001&session=post
the data would automatically log the participant identifier (001) and the session (post). These values can be set however the user prefers (any string will be accepted).
Wrapping Up the Task
On the final screen of the task (in which the screen says for the participant to notify the experimenter that the task is complete), you should exit out of the script by pressing “Q” on the keyboard. This will save the data locally to your computer. Do not exit out of the browser until you have pressed “Q” and saved the data. Although there is a backup data server implemented in the code, this is not always reliable.
